# Contributing to the Documentation

## Found an mistake or have a suggestion for improvement?

We welcome any feedback or contribution to the documentation.

Whether you spotted a mistake, have suggestions for new content or just want to say hi, feel to get in touch using the [mailing lists](http://servicemix.apache.org/community/mailing-lists.html), [IRC channel](http://servicemix.apache.org/community/irc.html) or on Twitter using the `#servicemix` hash tag.

## Contributing to the documentation code

The documentation is written in a combination of mark-up languages. Most of the pages are written
using Confluence mark-up or Markdown. The pages can be edited in any text editor.

Pages are grouped into books using the `toc.ssp` file in the enclosing folder. This file contains
an HTML formatted list defining the TOC for a book.

You can find more information about how to get and build the documentation codebase [here](http://servicemix.apache.org/developers/source/documentation-source.html) and one more thing...

... we really love documentation patches ;)
