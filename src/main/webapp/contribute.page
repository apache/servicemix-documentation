# Contributing to the Documentation

## Getting the Source

## Editing the Source

The documentation is written in a combination of mark-up languages. Most of the pages are written 
using Comfluence mark-up or Markdown. The pages can be editied in any text editor.

Pages are grouped into books using the `toc.ssp` file in the enclosing folder. This file contains 
an HTML formated list defining the TOC for a book.

## Building
You can build the documentation as follows:

    {pygmentize:: text}
    mvn install
    {pygmentize}

If you want to edit the files in your text editor and be able to immediately see the site re-rendered in a browser then use

    {pygmentize:: text}
    mvn jetty:run
    {pygmentize}

You can now surf the site and see changes immediately.

If you are on OS X then we highly recommend [TextMate](http://macromates.com/) as a great editor which supports Textile and Markdown
