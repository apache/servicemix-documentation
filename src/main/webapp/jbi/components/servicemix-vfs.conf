h3. Overview
The ServiceMix VFS component provides support for reading from and writing to virtual file systems via the enterprise service bus by using the Apache commons-vfs library.

h4. Namespace and xbean.xml
The namespace URI for the servicemix-bean JBI component is {{http://servicemix.apache.org/vfs/1.0}}.  This is an example of an {{xbean.xml}} file with a namespace definition with prefix {{bean}}.
