  <title>What is ServiceMix 4 ?</title>

  <para>Apache ServiceMix is an open source ESB (Enterprise Service Bus) that
  combines the functionality of a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and the
  modularity. The adoption of a Service Bus allows to decouple the applicatons
  together and reduce dependencies. Messages are used to wired the
  applications (=services) and/or connectors to exchange information using
  different protocols or communications mode like FTP, HTTP, WebServices,
  ...
  </para>
  
  <para>This new version of Apache ServiceMix is more than an evolution of the 
  previous as the kernel of the platform has been completety rewritten and is designed
  top of the OSGI specification. Using OSGI framework brings a new important feature
  for SOA development : modularity. That means that we can handle classloading and application
  lifecycle differently between the components. 
  </para>
  
  <para>ServiceMix is lightweight and easily embeddable, has integrated Spring
  support and can be run at the edge of the network (inside a client or
  server), as a standalone ESB provider or as a service within another ESB.
  You can use ServiceMix in Java SE or Java EE application server.
